Documentation URL: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/annotations

In swagger-maven-plugin:
AbstractDocumentSource has a Reader (SpringMVC & Abstract)
ApiDocumentMojo uses the DocumentSource

What I will do is:
Do the Document Reader which is mainly the Reader in above!

ApiDocumetMojo: 
- Will just validate ApiSource
- Will send ApiSource to DocumentSource, and get a swagger (WILL NOT CREATE A SWAGGER)
- Will write the swagger to File

DocumentSource:
- Will apply logic to generate the swagger, like sort!,..do this and not that by calling Swagger Reader
- Send ApiSource to Swagger Reader
- (MAYBE HAVE THE LOGIC TO WRITE TO THE FILE HERE!)
- Will get the classes that has annotation API and use the reader to set them

Swagger Reader:
- Will use component utilities to create swagger components

In the generator class there will be a check if Api is hidden do nothing!!
